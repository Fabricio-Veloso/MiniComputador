This is one of the first programs that I made. It should be just a simple terminal program with some functionalities: a text editor, a simple bomb game, an agenda/calendar, and a contat list.
At the time, I was using an online compiler that had very limited library support, so I did not use a simple terminal one like Ncurses. This program does not have these functionalities.
but is by far the most important one that I made. The foundations and base knowledge that this exercise taught me mean a lot and remind me of the way that I chose to learn programming and how important it is to me.
